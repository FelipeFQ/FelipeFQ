# 👋 Hi, I’m Felipe  

I’m a self-taught data enthusiast transitioning from customer service to the data field.  
Over the last 2 years, I’ve been learning and applying:  
- 🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- 🗄️ SQL for querying and manipulating data  
- 📊 Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 🤖 Introduction to Machine Learning  

My background in customer service gave me strong communication and problem-solving skills, which I now combine with technical knowledge to analyze data and generate insights.  

🚀 I’m currently developing portfolio projects (Kaggle notebooks, Python-based applications) and seeking opportunities as a **Junior Data Analyst**, with the long-term goal of becoming a **Data Scientist**.  

⚡ Outside of data, I am a **high-performance ultimate frisbee athlete**, which has taught me discipline, resilience, and teamwork at a competitive level. I bring the same focus and persistence from sports into my professional journey in tech.
